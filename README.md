The first project in the repository is a survey form. It features a variety of input fields, including text, email, number, and select options. The form gathers information such as name, email, age (optional), current role, enjoyment level of the survey, favourite type of feature, and areas for improvement. Users can also provide additional comments in a text area. The form is styled with a clean and modern design, using a white background, readable fonts, and a responsive layout. It offers a user-friendly experience with input validation and a submit button.
