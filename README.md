# Responsive-Web-Design
Small responsive web design projects.

1. Forms
The first project in the repository is a survey form. It features a variety of input fields, including text, email, number, and select options. The form gathers information such as name, email, age (optional), current role, enjoyment level of the survey, favourite type of feature, and areas for improvement. Users can also provide additional comments in a text area. The form is styled with a clean and modern design, using a white background, readable fonts, and a responsive layout. It offers a user-friendly experience with input validation and a submit button.

2. Tribute Page
   The second project in the repository is a tribute page. It's a really simple HTML and CSS project used for practising web development skills. The tribute page is dedicated to a chosen subject, such as a historical figure, a notable personality, or a beloved artist. It serves as a platform to honour and showcase information about the chosen subject, providing an overview of their life, achievements, and contributions.
   It incorporates text, images, and styling techniques to present the information in an organized and engaging manner. The page includes headings, paragraphs, lists, and links to external resources for further exploration.
